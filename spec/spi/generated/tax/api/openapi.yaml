  description: "## Overview\nTax Service Adapter is a Service Provider Interface (SPI)\
    \ that helps Chargebee communicate with API platforms providing the following\
    \ services:\n- Address validation\n- Estimating taxes for sales\n- Submitting\
    \ invoices for tax filing\n\nIf you have an API that provides the services mentioned\
    \ above and want Chargebee to be able to integrate with it, you can build an adapter\
    \ service according to this specification.\n\n## Terminology\nHere's a list of\
    \ terms we've used to describe this specification.\n### Merchant \n  Chargebee’\
    s customer who is carrying out the business of selling products. Also known as\
    \ the Seller. The Seller has one or more Chargebee accounts.\n### Chargebee \n\
    \ The SaaS which manages subscriptions and revenue operations on behalf of the\
    \ Merchant. Chargebee makes API calls to the Tax Service Adapter for tax estimation\
    \ and tax filing of transactions between the Merchant and the Customer.\n### Customer\
    \ \nMerchant’s customer who purchases products from the Merchant. Their customer\
    \ record(s) and other details are stored within Chargebee under the Merchant’\
    s account.\n### Tax Authority\nThe institution, usually a government, that is\
    \ responsible for collecting taxes for commercial transactions between Merchants\
    \ and their Customers.  \n### Tax Service Provider\nThe service which provides\
    \ tax estimation and tax filing services for merchants.\n### Tax Service Adapter\
    \ \nThe SPI for which the spec is defined in this document. This adapter serves\
    \ the following purposes:\n- Translates API requests (as defined in this document)\
    \ from Chargebee to the request format specified by the Tax Service Provider's\
    \ API.\n- Translates API responses from the Tax Service Provider APIs to the format\
    \ understood by Chargebee (as defined in this document).\n### Authorization\n\
    Chargebee uses HTTP header-based authorization for all the API endpoints associated\
    \ with Tax Service Adapter. We dynamically pass this authorization key in the\
    \ HTTP header. The parameter that holds this key is found in the JSON object `api_configuration`\
    \ required for configuring your onboarding on Chargebee's marketplace. In the\
    \ `api_configuration` object, our [Taxes Service Adapter SPI](https://chargebee.atlassian.net/l/cp/ca5aZ1mA)\
    \ checks the authorization key parameter from `credential_configuration.id` and\
    \ creates the HTTP header-based input query parameter for authorization. The `credential_configuration`\
    \ is an array of objects with an `id` attribute, and the value of `id` is the\
    \ parameter containing the authorization key.\n\n  Following are the JSON snippets\
    \ for your reference.\n\n   ```json\n      \"api_configuration\": {\n        \
    \  \"api_base_url\": \"https://xyz.abc.com/chargebee\",\n          \"credential_configuration\"\
    : [ \n            {\n              \"id\":\"authorization_key\",\n           \
    \   \"name\": \"Authorization Key\", \n              \"type\": \"text\",\n   \
    \           \"is_sensitive\": true \n            },\n            {\n         \
    \     \"id\": \"client_secret\",\n              \"name\": \"Client Secret\",\n\
    \              \"type\": \"text\",\n              \"is_sensitive\": true\n   \
    \         }\n          ]\n        }\n   ```    \n`\"Authorization\":\"{\"<authorization_key>\"\
