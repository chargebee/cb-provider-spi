## Developing an App to Integrate with Chargebee

Chargebee partners can use the [Service Provider Interfaces (SPI)](https://spidocs.chargebee.com/api-reference/partner-spi/overview) to develop apps that seamlessly integrate with Chargebee. These apps extend Chargebee's core capabilities to support diverse business use cases.

### Steps to Develop Your Application

1. **Understand the OpenAPI Specification**: Review the OpenAPI specification and integration details to design and build an app with seamless functionality.
2. **Implement SPI-Defined Endpoints**: Develop endpoints as outlined in the SPI documentation to ensure compatibility with Chargebee’s ecosystem.
3. **Adhere to Requirements**: Review the [General Requirements](#general-requisites) and [Technical Requirements](#technical-requisites) to ensure compliance with Chargebee’s guidelines.
4. **Test the Integration**: Perform both **API Testing** and **End-to-End Testing** to ensure a seamless integration with Chargebee:
    - **API Testing**: Validate and test your App using the provided [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/chargebee/chargebee-partners/overview).
    - **End-to-End Testing**: Test all required Chargebee use cases by integrating your app with Chargebee’s sandbox environment. To request sandbox access, [follow](#go-live-steps) -> Step 3.
